<h2> Hi, I'm Liam Volschenk! </h2>
<p><em>Hello, my name is Liam Volschenk, I am an aspiring web developer with a passion for photography, design, technology and problem solving.

I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js). However, I am a fast learner and I enjoy learning and adapting to any technologies or stack.

I hope to use my work as a means of growing our economy fairly and safe guarding our environment for all future generations to enjoy.
